CubbyTower is a simple tower defense game using C++ with Entity Component System (ECS). The code is built on C++17 and can be compiled with commonly available compilers such as g++, clang++, or Microsoft Visual Studio. CubbyTower currently supports macOS (10.14 or later), Ubuntu (18.04 or later), Windows (Visual Studio 2017 or later), and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Other untested platforms that support C++17 also should be able to build CubbyTower.

## Key Features

  * C++17 and ECS based simple tower defense game
  * C++ and Python API

## Quick Start

You will need CMake to build the code. If you're using Windows, you need Visual Studio 2017 in addition to CMake.

First, clone the code:

```
git clone https://github.com/utilForever/CubbyTower.git --recursive
cd CubbyTower
```

### C++ API

For macOS or Linux or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

For Windows:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G"Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"
MSBuild CubbyTower.sln /p:Configuration=Release
```
