# We don't want statistics for the tests themselves and certainly not for the
# benchmarks and boost libraries. Note that while we exclude the gcov data for
# these patterns in the codecov call (codecov --gcov-glob ...), the fact that
# our code references these areas also means we need to tell codecov itself to
# ignore them from the stats.
